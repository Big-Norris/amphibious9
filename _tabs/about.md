# 🐸 About Amphibious9

G'day! I'm **Ngaire "Nine" Lavander**, and welcome to my little corner of the internet where landscaping meets amphibian appreciation! 

## 🌿 What I Do

I specialize in creating **living retaining walls** and transforming backyards into sustainable, beautiful spaces.

## 🛠️ My Journey

After years of "hard yakka" in the landscaping industry, I've developed a passion for creating functional yet beautiful outdoor spaces.

## 🪏 Living Retaining Walls

My specialty is building retaining walls that aren't just functional barriers, but **living ecosystems**.

## 🐸 The Amphibious Connection

Why "Amphibious9"? Well, frogs are fantastic indicators of environmental health!
