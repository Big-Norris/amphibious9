# 🐸 About Amphibious9

Hiya! I'm **Ngaire Lavender** though most people call me **Nine**, and this is my little corner of the internet where landscaping meets amphibian appreciation! 

## 🌿 What I Do

Put simply, I demolish, prepare, and rebuild beautiful gardens. My range expands from sweet little backyards to luxury landscapes. It's my absolute passion and pleasure to restore life and rejuvenate the homes of people around me.

## 🛠️ My Journey

After years of "hard yakka" in the landscaping industry, I've developed a passion for creating functional yet beautiful outdoor spaces. This has led me to exploring my idea of developing living retaining walls, specifically, walls that are self thriving and inviting to our slimy little froggie friends. I want to share my journey with you as I learn through trial and error to make this vision a reality. 

## 🪏 Living Retaining Walls

My interest is building retaining walls that aren't just functional barriers, but **living ecosystems**. My inspiration comes from my love of ferns, moss, amphibian creatures and contributing to a sustainable practice. 

## 🐸 The Amphibious Connection

Why "Amphibious9"? Well, frogs are fantastic indicators of environmental health and my mission is to bring that into your garden.
